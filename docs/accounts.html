  <body><h1>Account management</h1><p>The main components of this system and their behaviour of the will be described in this document</p><p>We start with <em>firms</em>. They are our target clients.</p><h2>Firms</h2><p>There will be a onboarding process to add a new firm to our system.<br/>The onboarding process will capture the relevant information about the firm.</p><h3>Basic Information</h3><ol><li>Firm Name</li><li>email</li><li>Phone number</li></ol><p>Before proceding, the above things should be verified as necessary.</p><h3>Portfolio</h3><p>Next, we move on to creating portfolio for the firm.<br/>A portfolio is the showcase of the firmâ€™s existing work.<br/>It may contain one or many <em>projects.</em></p><p>A <em>project</em> refers to work done for a customer.<br/>This may be past work, current work or any work that is to be done in the future.<br/>This data can be used showcase the past projects, reflect and take action on<br/>the ongoing project. Plan and manage multiple projects.<br/>In other words, <em>project</em> is a central idea for us. More info on this will<br/>be provided in the next section.</p><p>Coming back to the onboarding, in the next steps they should be able to create a showcase<br/>of their past projects by adding projects and their data (images / 3d model etc)</p><h3>Invitations to team</h3><p>They should be able to invite other people to their workspace via email/phone.<br/>Here, we can have following permission scheme:</p><ol><li>Access to all projects</li><li>Access only when added to project</li></ol><p>We will discuss more about permissions in a later chapter.</p><h2>Designers et. al.</h2><p>A firm is made of designers as well as other people who help with the business. For us, this<br/>is about access control of the actions to be performed on projects owned by the firm.</p><p>They can only be added by a firm by iniviting via email/phone.</p><h2>Customers</h2><p>They are the people for whom the project is being worked on.<br/>Firm / Designers from their dashboard should be able to initiate a new project and add the<br/>customer from there.</p><p>The customer will receive an email with the link to access the dashboard.</p><h2>Projects</h2><p>This is the central resource on which the people will work.<br/>Some of the metadata for this are as following:</p><ol><li>Project Name</li><li>Start Date</li><li>End Date</li><li>Budget</li><li>Images</li><li>3d models</li><li>Breakdown of components charged for</li></ol><p>A typical breakdown of component could be on a per room basis.<br/>In that case, a component should hold the following information</p><ol><li>Label <i>(room name here)</i></li><li>Name of component</li><li>Status <i>(Discussed / Ordered / Installed)</i></li><li>Dimensions</li><li>Price</li></ol><p>Note here, that we also need to be able to capture the date on which the status of a<br/>component changed (could be done via additional columns or whatever)</p>
